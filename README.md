# Coursera Data Science Specialization - Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This is my work for the course project.
The repo contains:
- The run_analysis.R script: it performs the cleaning and analysis of the "_data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone_". A complete description of the original data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The data itself can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
